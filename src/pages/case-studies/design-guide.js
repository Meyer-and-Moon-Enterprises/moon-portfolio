          overview="IBM's workplace transformation led to a surge in demand for design assets from the Chief Information Office. The CIO design team expanded and took on numerous projects, but this growth inadvertently caused a lack of cohesion and double-work. To address these issues, the CIO Design Guide was created to unify the internal landscape, integrate a new design language, and reduce double-work."

          description="The lack of clear internal brand guidance causes a disjointed experience for employees. Every day thousands of employees access the intranet and other IBM tools to get their jobâ€™s done. It can be difficult for employees to distinguish between tools and experiences that are meant for internal vs. external use, leading to confusion and potential security risks for the company. The complexity of this project was impacted by the release and mandated adoption of the new IBM Design Language which was misaligned with the existing patchwork of internal-facing experiences. "
